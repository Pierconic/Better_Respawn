Pretty self explanatory; instead of beds, players must craft and upgrade respawn anchors in order to set their spawn point, repurposing monster spawners as the primary ingredient. Ideally balances gameplay by encouraging exploration, (to find more spawners), while negating the tendency of beds to remove any challenge from the game whatsoever.
Four anchor types; Memory anchors function in the Overworld, Duat Anchors function in the Nether, Khaos anchors in the End; and Abzu anchors in the overworld, exclusively underwater. Anchors require experience to recharge, and are increasingly difficult to upgrade. They also have cool sound effects.
...So far, haven't found a good way to replace advancement descriptions related to respawning, and the "Respawn point set" message for beds- overriding the lang file seems to have no effect? TBH, if someone's downloaded this, they presumably understand how respawning works... but still...
